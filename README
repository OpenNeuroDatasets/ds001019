Whole-brain imaging was conducted on a Siemens Trio 3 Tesla system equipped with a 32-channel head coil (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). fMRI measurements were performed using single-shot echo-planar imaging with parallel imaging (GRAPPA, in-plane acceleration factor 2; TR = 1240 ms, TE = 26 ms, flip angle = 60; 2 x 2 x 2 mm voxel size; 40 axial slices with a 1 mm gap)(Griswold et al., 2002) and simultaneous multi-slice acquisitions ("multiband", slice acceleration factor 2)(Feinberg et al., 2010; Moeller et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2013) as described in(Setsompop et al., 2012). The corresponding image reconstruction algorithm was provided by the University of Minnesota Center for Magnetic Resonance Research. Slices were tilted approximately 30° relative to the AC–PC line to improve signal-to-noise ratio in the orbitofrontal cortex(Deichmann et al., 2003). Head padding was used to minimize head motion. Three participants were excluded for excessive head motion (a total of 5 or more > 2.0 mm framewise displacement translations from TR to TR per learning phase block).
	During the learning phase, four functional runs of an average of ~10 min and 45 s were collected, each including 10 maze trials. During the localizer phase, one functional run of an average of ~15 min was collected. For each functional scanning run, four discarded volumes were collected prior to the first trial to allow for magnetic field equilibration and to collect reference data for multiband reconstruction. 
Structural images were collected using a high-resolution T1-weighted magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (MPRAGE) pulse sequence (1 x 1 x 1 mm voxel size) between the learning phase and the test phase.
